# WEEK 10 INTERMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT
In the exciting project of Week 10, my team and I successfully crafted a dynamic RESTful API server powered by a MongoDB database. This ingenious application empowers us to carry out essential tasks such as user registration and seamless login functionality. To delve into the system's offerings, individuals are first required to create their personal accounts via the registration process. Following this, a successful login grants access. Each user assumes a distinct role - either "maker" or "approver." For instance, as a "maker," I can initiate a transfer request, initiating a suspenseful pending phase. Later on, it's intriguing to know that the "approver" takes the reins, deciding whether to grant approval or hold off. The project truly immerses us into the realms of robust API development and database management.
